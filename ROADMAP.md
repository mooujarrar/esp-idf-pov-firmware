Exactly âœ… â€” you nailed it.

Î”t is **not fixed by physics**, itâ€™s a design choice you make depending on how smooth you want the image to look:

---

### 1. Relation Between Î”t and Number of Slices

* You decide how many angular slices per rotation (`N_slices`) you want.
* Then:

$$
\Delta t = \frac{T}{N_{\text{slices}}}
$$

* More slices â†’ smoother image, but requires more LED updates per second.
* Fewer slices â†’ less smooth, but easier to compute and send to WLED.

---

### 2. Constraints

* **Wheel speed**: at higher RPM, the period T gets smaller, so Î”t shrinks â†’ updates must be faster.
* **Your MCU/network speed**: you can only push updates so fast (UDP to WLED is pretty fast, but still has limits).
* **Human eye persistence**: for smooth POV, you typically want at least \~100â€“200 updates per second.

---

### 3. Example

Suppose:

* Wheel rotates once every **0.5s** (T = 500 ms, \~120 RPM).
* You want **180 slices per rotation** (2Â° per slice).

Then:

$$
\Delta t = \frac{500 \text{ ms}}{180} \approx 2.77 \text{ ms}
$$

Thatâ€™s **360 updates per second** â†’ pretty demanding!

If instead you pick **60 slices (6Â° per slice)**:

$$
\Delta t = \frac{500}{60} \approx 8.33 \text{ ms}
$$

Thatâ€™s **120 updates per second** â†’ more reasonable.

---

### 4. Strategy

* Start with a small `N_slices` (like 30â€“60 per rotation).
* If your system (Rust code + WLED + WiFi/UDP) can handle it, increase `N_slices`.
* Balance between performance and visual smoothness.

---

ðŸ‘‰ So yes: **Î”t is directly tied to how many angular slices you want to display per rotation**. The hall sensor only gives you T; the rest is your design choice.

Would you like me to suggest a **rule of thumb** for choosing `N_slices` based on wheel RPM and LED count, so you can avoid picking an unrealistic update rate?
